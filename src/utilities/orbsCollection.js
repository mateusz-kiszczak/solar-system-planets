    description: 'Pluto is a tiny world of rock and ice, only two-thirds the size of Earth\'s Moon. It is one of five dwarf planets in our Solar System that have so far been discovered. Dwarf planets are objects orbiting the Sun which are smaller than a planet. They are mostly round in shape. Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake are all found in the outer reaches of the Solar System within the Kuiper Belt. This is a broad ring of objects that begins around the orbit of Neptune and extends out to roughly 15 billion km (9.3 billion miles) from the Sun. The fifth dwarf planet, Ceres, lies in the asteroid belt.',

    name: 'neptune',
    description: 'Neptune is the second coldest planet in the Solar System after Uranus, and the furthest from the Sun. Methane gas in its upper atmosphere makes it look blue in colour. At the top of its cloud layers, the temperature is usually a freezing -201째C (-330째F), though it can get even colder. Unlike its calm neighbour Uranus, Neptune often experiences raging storms. The planet takes its name from the ancient Roman god of the sea.',

    name: 'uranus',
    description: 'Uranus is the third largest planet in the Solar System and the second furthest from the Sun. While most planets spin like tops on an axis, Uranus spins on its side like a rolling ball. Scientists believe that a major collision with an object much larger than an asteroid caused the planet to tip over. Uranus is named after the ancient Greek god of the sky. It is very hard to see from Earth with the naked eye, and it was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope.',

    description: 'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second largest planet in our Solar System after Jupiter. It is famous for its huge system of colourful rings. Saturn has a large family of more than 60 moons. Like Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, Saturn is a gas giant - a huge ball of gas and liquid with a small solid core at its very centre. Saturn was named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth. ',

    description: 'The fifth planet from the Sun, Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System. It is more than 1,300 times the volume of Earth. Jupiter is a gas giant, made mostly of hydrogen and helium with a small rocky core. Near the surface, powerful forces whip up clouds of brightly coloured misty-looking gas, forming storms that can grow bigger than the Earth and last for hundreds of years. Jupiter was named after the king of the Roman gods.',

    description: 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, after Mercury, Venus, and Earth. It is a rocky planet about half the size of Earth. Mars and Earth share some similarities. Both planets have seasons, and both have layers of ice at their north and south poles. However, unlike Earth, the surface of Mars is cold and dry, with only a thin atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide gas. Its name comes from the Roman god of war.',

It has two things that are vital for living creatures: an atmosphere rich in oxygen, and a large supply of liquid water on its surface. Earth sits at an ideal distance from the Sun - if it were any closer, it would be so hot that water would boil away. If it were any further away, its surface would be cold and frozen, like the planet Mars.',

Although it is a similar size and weight to Earth, humans could never live on Venus. Its atmosphere is thick with poisonous gas, and temperatures on the ground are hotter than an oven. The surface of Venus is hidden by thick clouds of sulphuric acid. Despite its dangerous environment, Venus takes its name from the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty.',

    description: 'Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. During the day, temperatures can reach a blistering 430째C (806째F), which is hot enough to melt lead. However, Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, so the heat of the day escapes very quickly at night time. Nights on Mercury are freezing cold, much colder than the coldest place on Earth. The name Mercury comes from a Roman god renowned for his swiftness.',

The source of its power lies deep in its central core, which is like a continually exploding nuclear bomb giving out enormous amounts of energy. The Sun is by far the biggest and heaviest object in the whole Solar System, and its gravity keeps everything else travelling around it in slightly flattened circular paths called orbits.',
